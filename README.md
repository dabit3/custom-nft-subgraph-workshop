## Building an NFT API with filtering, sorting, relationships, and full text search with The Graph.

In this workshop we'll build a subgraph for querying NTF data from the [Cryptocoven](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5180db8F5c931aaE63c74266b211F580155ecac8#code) smart contract, implementing queries for fetching NFTs as well as their owners, building relationships between them, full text search, sorting, and filtering.

> The codebase for this project is located [here](https://github.com/dabit3/cryptocoven-api)

### Prerequisites

To be successful in this tutorial, you should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. These days, I recommend using either [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm/blob/master/docs/commands.md) to manage Node.js versions.

### Creating the Graph project in the Graph Explorer

To get started, open [The Graph Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/) and either sign in or create a new account.

Next, go to the [dashboard](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard) and click on __Add Subgraph__ to create a new subgraph.

Configure your subgraph with the following properties:

- Subgraph Name - __Cryptocovenapi__
- Subtitle - __A subgraph for querying Cryptocoven NFTs__
- Optional - Fill the description and GITHUB URL properties

Once the subgraph is created, we will initialize the subgraph locally using the Graph CLI.

### Initializing a new subgraph using the Graph CLI

Next, install the Graph CLI:

```sh
$ npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli

# or

$ yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

Once the Graph CLI has been installed you can initialize a new subgraph with the Graph CLI `init` command.

There are two ways to initialize a new subgraph:

1 - From an example subgraph

```sh
$ graph init --from-example <GITHUB_USERNAME>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME> [<DIRECTORY>]
```

2 - From an existing smart contract

If you already have a smart contract deployed to Ethereum mainnet or one of the testnets, initializing a new subgraph from this contract is an easy way to get up and running.

```sh
$ graph init --from-contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  [--network <ETHEREUM_NETWORK>] \
  [--abi <FILE>] \
  <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME> [<DIRECTORY>]
```

In our case we'll be starting with the [Cryptocoven NFT contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5180db8F5c931aaE63c74266b211F580155ecac8#code) so we can initialize from that contract address by passing in the contract address using the `--from-contract` flag:

```sh
$ graph init --from-contract 0x5180db8F5c931aaE63c74266b211F580155ecac8 --protocol ethereum \
--network mainnet --contract-name Token --index-events

? Product for which to initialize › hosted-service
? Subgraph name › your-username/cryptocovenapi
? Directory to create the subgraph in › cryptocovenapi
? Ethereum network › Mainnet
? Contract address › 0x5180db8F5c931aaE63c74266b211F580155ecac8
? Contract Name · Token
```

This command will generate a basic subgraph based off of the contract address passed in as the argument to `--from-contract`. By using this contract address, the CLI will initialize a few things in your project to get you started (including fetching the `abis` and saving them in the __abis__ directory).

> By passing in `--index-events` the CLI will automatically populate some code for us both in __schema.graphql__ as well as __src/mapping.ts__ based on the events emitted from the contract.

The main configuration and definition for the subgraph lives in the __subgraph.yaml__ file. The subgraph codebase consists of a few files:

- __subgraph.yaml__: a YAML file containing the subgraph manifest
- __schema.graphql__: a GraphQL schema that defines what data is stored for your subgraph, and how to query it via GraphQL
- __AssemblyScript Mappings__: AssemblyScript code that translates from the event data in Ethereum to the entities defined in your schema (e.g. mapping.ts in this tutorial)

The entries in __subgraph.yaml__ that we will be working with are:

- `description` (optional): a human-readable description of what the subgraph is. This description is displayed by the Graph Explorer when the subgraph is deployed to the Hosted Service.
- `repository` (optional): the URL of the repository where the subgraph manifest can be found. This is also displayed by the Graph Explorer.
- `dataSources.source`: the address of the smart contract the subgraph sources, and the abi of the smart contract to use. The address is optional; omitting it allows to index matching events from all contracts.
- `dataSources.source.startBlock` (optional): the number of the block that the data source starts indexing from. In most cases we suggest using the block in which the contract was created.
- `dataSources.mapping.entities` : the entities that the data source writes to the store. The schema for each entity is defined in the the schema.graphql file.
- `dataSources.mapping.abis`: one or more named ABI files for the source contract as well as any other smart contracts that you interact with from within the mappings.
- `dataSources.mapping.eventHandlers`: lists the smart contract events this subgraph reacts to and the handlers in the mapping — __./src/mapping.ts__ in the example — that transform these events into entities in the store.

### Defining the entities

With The Graph, you define entity types in __schema.graphql__, and Graph Node will generate top level fields for querying single instances and collections of that entity type. Each type that should be an entity is required to be annotated with an `@entity` directive.

The entities / data we will be indexing are the `Token` and `User`.

To populate the entities, we'll be fetching metadata from IPFS using the token ID to get information like the token name, image, and description.

For example, the base URI for cryptocoven is:

```
ipfs://QmSr3vdMuP2fSxWD7S26KzzBWcAN1eNhm4hk1qaR3x3vmj
```

Therefore, we can visit a URI like:

```
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSr3vdMuP2fSxWD7S26KzzBWcAN1eNhm4hk1qaR3x3vmj/234.json
```

and see all of the metadata for the token.

Using this IPFS URI, we'll be able to call out to IPFS to retreive this data based on the token ID.

Update __schema.graphql__ with the following code:

```graphql
type Token @entity {
  id: ID!
  tokenID: BigInt!
  tokenURI: String!
  externalURL: String!
  ipfsURI: String!
  image: String!
  name: String!
  description: String!
  type: String!
  sun: String!
  moon: String!
  rising: String!
  updatedAtTimestamp: BigInt!
  owner: User!
}

type User @entity {
  id: ID!
  tokens: [Token!]! @derivedFrom(field: "owner")
}

type _Schema_
  @fulltext(
    name: "covenSearch"
    language: en
    algorithm: rank
    include: [{entity: "Token", fields:
      [{ name: "name" }, { name: "description" }, { name: "type" }, { name: "sun" }, { name: "moon" }, { name: "rising" }
    ] }]
  )
```

### On Relationships via `@derivedFrom` (from the docs):

Reverse lookups can be defined on an entity through the `@derivedFrom` field. This creates a virtual field on the entity that may be queried but cannot be set manually through the mappings API. Rather, it is derived from the relationship defined on the other entity. For such relationships, it rarely makes sense to store both sides of the relationship, and both indexing and query performance will be better when only one side is stored and the other is derived.

For one-to-many relationships, the relationship should always be stored on the 'one' side, and the 'many' side should always be derived. Storing the relationship this way, rather than storing an array of entities on the 'many' side, will result in dramatically better performance for both indexing and querying the subgraph. In general, storing arrays of entities should be avoided as much as is practical.

Now that we have created the GraphQL schema for our app, we can generate the entities locally to start using in the `mappings` created by the CLI:

```sh
graph codegen
```

In order to make working smart contracts, events and entities easy and type-safe, the Graph CLI generates AssemblyScript types from a combination of the subgraph's GraphQL schema and the contract ABIs included in the data sources.

## Updating the subgraph with the entities and mappings

Now we can configure the __subgraph.yaml__ to use the entities that we have just created and configure their mappings.

To do so, first update the `dataSources.mapping.entities` field with the `User` and `Token` entities:

```yaml
entities:
  - Token
  - User
```

Next, update the `dataSources.mapping.eventHandlers` to include only the following three event handlers:

```yaml
- event: Transfer(indexed address,indexed address,indexed uint256)
  handler: handleTransfer
```

Finally, update the configuration to add the `startBlock`:

```yaml
source:
  address: "0x5180db8F5c931aaE63c74266b211F580155ecac8"
  abi: Token
  startBlock: 13547115
```

If the spec version for the subgraph.yaml file is 0.0.4 then, the feature `fullTextSearch, ipfsOnEthereumContracts` has to be declared in the manifest as a top level, like specVersion or schema.
So, create a new key called features in the yaml file at the top level and declare these features as mentionsed below.

Thanks [drgorilla-eth](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/users/68134/drgorilla-eth) for pointing it out.

```yaml
features:
  - fullTextSearch
  - ipfsOnEthereumContracts
```

## Assemblyscript mappings

Next, open __src/mappings.ts__ to write the mappings that we defined in our subgraph subgraph `eventHandlers`.

The hosted service supports an [IPFS API](https://thegraph.com/docs/developer/assemblyscript-api#api-reference) that allows you to interact with data stored on the IPFS network.

This is especially useful for NFT metadata where you might have additional information about the NFT stored in JSON format which is the case with our API.

Update the file with the following code:

```typescript
import { ipfs, json } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'
import {
  Transfer as TransferEvent,
  Token as TokenContract
} from '../generated/Token/Token'
import {
Token, User
} from '../generated/schema'

const ipfshash = "QmSr3vdMuP2fSxWD7S26KzzBWcAN1eNhm4hk1qaR3x3vmj"

export function handleTransfer(event: TransferEvent): void {
  /* load the token from the existing Graph Node */
  let token = Token.load(event.params.tokenId.toString())
  if (!token) {
    /* if the token does not yet exist, create it */
    token = new Token(event.params.tokenId.toString())
    token.tokenID = event.params.tokenId
 
    token.tokenURI = "/" + event.params.tokenId.toString() + ".json"

    /* combine the ipfs hash and the token ID to fetch the token metadata from IPFS */
    let metadata = ipfs.cat(ipfshash + token.tokenURI)
    if (metadata) {
      const value = json.fromBytes(metadata).toObject()
      if (value) {
        /* using the metatadata from IPFS, update the token object with the values  */
        const image = value.get('image')
        const name = value.get('name')
        const description = value.get('description')
        const externalURL = value.get('external_url')

        if (name && image && description && externalURL) {
          token.name = name.toString()
          token.image = image.toString()
          token.externalURL = externalURL.toString()
          token.description = description.toString()
          token.ipfsURI = 'ipfs.io/ipfs/' + ipfshash + token.tokenURI
        }

        const coven = value.get('coven')
        if (coven) {
          let covenData = coven.toObject()
          const type = covenData.get('type')
          if (type) {
            token.type = type.toString()
          }

          const birthChart = covenData.get('birthChart')
          if (birthChart) {
            const birthChartData = birthChart.toObject()
            const sun = birthChartData.get('sun')
            const moon = birthChartData.get('moon')
            const rising = birthChartData.get('rising')
            if (sun && moon && rising) {
              token.sun = sun.toString()
              token.moon = moon.toString()
              token.rising = rising.toString()
            }
          }
        }
          
      }
    }
  }
  token.updatedAtTimestamp = event.block.timestamp

  /* set or update the owner field and save the token to the Graph Node */
  token.owner = event.params.to.toHexString()
  token.save()
  
  /* if the user does not yet exist, create them */
  let user = User.load(event.params.to.toHexString())
  if (!user) {
    user = new User(event.params.to.toHexString())
    user.save()
  }
 }
```

These mappings will handle events for when a new token is created or transferred. When this event fires, the mappings will save the data into the subgraph.

### Running a build

Next, let's run a build to make sure that everything is configured properly. To do so, run the `build` command:

```sh
$ graph build
```

If the build is successful, you should see a new __build__ folder generated in your root directory.

## Deploying the subgraph

To deploy, we can run the `deploy` command using the Graph CLI. To deploy, you will first need to copy the __Access token__ for your account, available in [The Graph dashboard](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard):

![Graph Dashboard](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/820lwqh8yo3iyu7fsbhj.jpg)

Next, run the following command:

```sh
$ graph auth
✔ Product for which to initialize · hosted-service
✔ Deploy key · ********************************

$ yarn deploy
```

Once the subgraph is deployed, you should see it show up in your dashboard:

![Graph Dashboard](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/19no8vdd1nlce9vl5c1j.jpg)

When you click on the subgraph, it should open the Graph explorer:

![The Foundation Subgraph](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v5o0xae2ccg6w8i6ozn5.png)

## Querying for data

Now that we are in the dashboard, we should be able to start querying for data. Run the following query to get a list of tokens and their metadata:

```graphql
{
  tokens(first: 5) {
    id
    tokenID
    tokenURI
    externalURL
    image 
    name 
    description
    type 
    sun 
    moon 
    rising 
    updatedAtTimestamp 
    owner {
      id 
    }
  }
}
```

We can also configure the order direction:

```graphql
{
  tokens(
    first: 5
    orderDirection: desc
    orderBy: updatedAtTimestamp
  ) {
    id
    tokenID
    tokenURI
    externalURL
    image 
    name 
    description
    type 
    sun 
    moon 
    rising 
    updatedAtTimestamp 
    owner {
      id 
    }
  }
}
```

Or choose to skip forward a certain number of results to implement some basic pagination:

```graphql
{
  tokens(
    skip: 100
    orderDirection: desc
    orderBy: updatedAtTimestamp
  ) {
    id
    tokenID
    tokenURI
    externalURL
    image 
    name 
    description
    type 
    sun 
    moon 
    rising 
    updatedAtTimestamp 
    owner {
      id 
    }
  }
}
```

Or query with filtering:

```graphql
{
  tokens(
    where: {
      sun_contains: "capricorn"
    }
  ) {
    sun 
    name
  }
}
```

And full text search

```graphql
{
  covenSearch(
    text: "'CRUSH PEARLS IN YOUR FISTS'"
  ) {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```
